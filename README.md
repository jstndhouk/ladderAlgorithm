# Ladder Algorithm

One night, I was working out at my group fitness gym, and we were doing a ladder that night.  A ladder in a fitness context is a count-down-like exercise scheme where you start perform an exercise a number of times, then decrease the reps by one for each following set until you reach zero reps.  For example, an 8-step ladder front-squat would have you squatting 8 times, 7 times, 6 times, etc..  I was curious as to the total numbers of reps I would be doing given a number of steps.  As I thought about it, I figured it would be a fun algorithm exercise.  This function takes in an integer greater than zero as a parameter and returns the total of number of reps that I ladder would make you do.  It was a fun little exercise that was prompted, by, well, exercise!

# Run Instructions

This can be executed by running the commandline "node ladderAlgorithm" if you have node installed.

# Call to Action

Would you have solved it differently?  I'd love to hear what you think.
